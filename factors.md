# FACTORS

## Algorithm to find all factors
A simple algorithm can be used to find all factors of a number. This guarantees
all factors are found. We will use the number 24 as an example. 

1. start with 1

2. try each each other number

3. remove any any numbers that do not divide exactly.

4. Stop when you reach repeating numbers. (like 4*6 and 6*4 in this example)

5. All factors are now listed.

(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24)
