* ACCESS MODIFIERS
Access modifiers are important for OOP (object oriented programming).

They control the visibility of data members and methods.

Preventing data access from certain areas of your program can help the developer write better, more organised code.
** PUBLIC
Public does NOT restrict data access from outside of the class.

Java, if no access modifier is given, it will implicitly default to public access. in C++, if no access modifier is given, STRUCTS will implicity default to public access.
** PRIVATE
Private provides total restriction to data access from outside of the class scope.

in C++, if no access modifier is given, CLASSES will implicitly default to private access.

Subclasses CANNOT access private variables of the Superclass.
** PROTECTED
The protected access modifier also allows data access via the use of subclasses.

In Java, the protected access modifier restricts data access from outside of the package (not the class).
